Unions are conceptually similar to Structures. The only difference between them is memory allocation. Structure allocates storage space for all its members separately; Whereas, Union allocates one common storage space for all its members. Members of a union can only be accessed one at a time. The union data type was invented to prevent memory fragmentation. The union data type prevents fragmentation by creating a standard size of certain data everything else remains same as Structures

In C, typedef is used to give an existing type an alias or a new name.

HOW TO INPUT INTO OUR data

    HexWord word;
    // Initialize the word with hexadecimal values (example: 0x1A2B3C4D)
    word.bytes[0].byte = 0x1A;
    word.bytes[1].byte = 0x2B;
    word.bytes[2].byte = 0x3C;
    word.bytes[3].byte = 0x4D;

    // Print the hexadecimal word
    printHexWord(word);

    Inside ParseHexWords

    printf("%c\t%c\n", lowNibble, highNibble);
    printf("%X\t%X\n", hexCharToByte(lowNibble), hexCharToByte(highNibble));

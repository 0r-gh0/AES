\section{Family Income and Expenses}

\subsection{Annual family Income}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 19.png}
	\caption{Income and Expenses}
	\label{G19}
\end{figure}

 Figure \ref{G19} indicates the fluctuations in annual family income among respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority, of $109$ participants have reported no significant change in their family income. However, $68$ participants experienced a bit decrease, while $22$ participants faced a substantial decrease. On a positive note, $27$ participants saw a moderate increase, and $4$ participants reported a significant boost in their annual family income.

\subsection{Annual family Expenses}

\subsection{Comparative Analysis of Family Expenditure Across Different\\ Employment Categories}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 33.jpeg}
	\caption{Percentage of Family Expenditure}
	\label{G33}
\end{figure}
$$\textit{Student($126$) | Employed($63$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

The bar chart depicts the distribution of family expenditure levels across three distinct categories of individuals: \textit{students, employed individuals, and the unemployed}. Expenditure levels are classified into four groups: "\textbf{Greatly Increased}," "\textbf{Remained Same}," "\textbf{Somewhat Decreased}," and "\textbf{Severely Decreased.}"

\ 

Let’s analyze the Family Expenditure, So for students, $10\%$ experienced a substantial increase in family expenditure, while a majority $(65.71\%)$ maintained a consistent level. Approximately $17.14\%$ observed a moderate decrease, and a smaller portion $(7.14\%)$ faced a significant reduction.

\

Among employed individuals, $21.88\%$ noted a substantial rise in family expenditure, while the largest portion $(59.37\%)$ sustained a steady spending pattern. About $12.5\%$ experienced a moderate decline, and a smaller proportion $(6.25\%)$ encountered a considerable drop.

\

Unemployed individuals experienced noteworthy changes as well, with $20.83\%$ noting a significant increase, $58.33\%$ maintaining consistency, $16.67\%$ observing a moderate reduction, and a minority $(4.17\%)$ facing a substantial decrease in family spending.

\newpage 

\

\textbf{Key Insights : }

\ 

Consistency Among Employees:  The largest percentage of both employed individuals and students maintained similar family expenditure levels, with around $59.37\%$ and $65.71\%$, respectively, staying consistent.

\ 

Impact of Unemployment: Unemployed individuals showcased a slightly higher percentage in experiencing increased family expenditure $(20.83\%)$ compared to employed individuals $(21.88\%)$.

\ 

Variance in Decreased Expenditure: There is a notable difference in the percentage of individuals who experienced a severe decrease in family spending among the employed $(6.25\%)$ compared to students $(7.14\%)$ and the unemployed $(4.17\%)$.

\ 

This breakdown of family expenditure across employment categories offers valuable insights into how different groups manage their expenses amidst varying employment statuses.


\subsection{Comparative Analysis of Income Change Across Different\\ Employment Categories}

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{Percentage of Differences in Incomes}
	\label{G34}
\end{figure}
$$\textit{Student($126$) | Employed($63$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

The bar chart provides an overview of income change percentages across three distinct categories of individuals: \textit{students, employed individuals, and the unemployed}. The income change percentages are divided into five groups: "\textbf{Greatly Increased}", "\textbf{Somewhat Increased}", "\textbf{Remained Same}", "\textbf{Somewhat Decreased}", and "\textbf{Severely Decreased}".

\ 

In the case of students, $1.59\%$ experienced a significant increase in income, while $9.52\%$ observed a moderate rise. A substantial majority of students $(46.03\%)$ maintained a consistent income level, with approximately $33.33\%$ facing a moderate decrease and $9.52\%$ encountering a substantial reduction.

\ 

Among employed individuals, $3.17\%$ saw a notable increase in income, and $19.05\%$ experienced a moderate rise. The largest portion of employed individuals $(52.38\%)$ sustained a steady income level, while around $17.46\%$ observed a moderate decline, and $7.94\%$ faced a substantial reduction.

\

For unemployed individuals, none experienced a significant increase, and $7.5\%$ observed a moderate rise. A significant majority $(42.5\%)$ maintained a consistent income level, while around $37.5\%$ experienced a moderate decrease, and $12.5\%$ encountered a substantial reduction.

\ 

Analyzing these figures reveals that the largest percentage of employed individuals $(52.38\%)$ maintained a steady income level, surpassing both students $(46.03\%)$ and unemployed individuals $(42.5\%)$. Moreover, a notable portion of students $(33.33\%)$ faced a moderate decrease in income, exceeding the corresponding percentages for employed and unemployed individuals.

\ 

It is noteworthy that the percentage of unemployed individuals experiencing any level of increased income $(7.5\%)$ is notably lower compared to students $(11.11\%)$ and employed individuals $(22.22\%)$. This breakdown of income change percentages across employment categories provides insights into the varying income dynamics experienced by different groups based on their employment status.

\end{figure}
$$\textit{Employed($63$) | Retired($1$) | Student($126$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

The bar graph in Figure \ref{G5} illustrates the difference in incomes between the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic period for participants with different employment status. It is measured in percentage. Overall it can be observed that the income remained almost same or somewhat decreased in each employment category.

\ 

Almost half of the participants with the employed, student and unemployed status had their salary unaffected and also the retired one. In the group of student and unemployed ones, $1/3^{rd}$  portion and among employed ones $17.46\%$  had slight decrement in their income. Only a very small part in employed and student category claimed great increase in their income. About $10\%$ participant's salary got critically decreased.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 14.png}
	\caption{Dependence on Cooked Food Delivery System}
	\label{G14}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{G13} and Figure \ref{G14} illustrate a comparison between the number of times the participants ordered food online in a month before, during and after COVID-19. The majority of participants, regardless of the pandemic, exhibit a trend of ordering food online 0-3 times per month.

\newpage

\subsection{Changes in Online Food ordering frequency}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 15.png}
	\caption{Dependence on Cooked Food Delivery System}
	\label{G15}
\end{figure}

\

The data provided in Figure 4.3 illustrates the frequency dependence on ready-made food delivery systems. The majority of the respondents reported that their dependence on ready-made food delivery remained the same, while a smaller percentage indicated a somewhat decreased dependence and an even smaller percentage reported a severe decrease in dependence. Conversely, some respondents mentioned a somewhat increased dependence on ready-made food delivery, but the number of responses with greatly increased dependence has been very low.

\ 

This data mostly indicates two aspects of thought processes adapted by people during the COVID-19 Lockdown period. A significant number of families believed that the Virus could be carried through right into the house with the ready-made food despite all the precaution and contactless delivery etc. Hence, the chances of contamination may increase. Therefore, they somewhat decreased ordering ready-made food. On the other hand, a significant amount of people felt the need of ordering ready-made food more often than before. This may be due to lack of availability of raw cooking materials during the Lockdown period, or it might be safe to say that a few got addicted to an easier lifestyle that the pandemic offered.

$$\textit{Employed($63$) | Retired($1$) | Student($126$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

Figure \ref{G6} represents the change in ‘Dependence on cooked-food delivery system’ due to pandemic for participants corresponding to several employment status. It is measured in corresponding frequency. 

\ 

From the mere observation, it can be seen that there has been some upward trend in the \textbf{“0-3 times per month}” segment among the student and employed participants. Whereas the no. of unemployed and retired ones in this segment remained same as before COVID.\\ \\
The no. of students and employed persons in the “\textbf{4-10 times per month}” segment gets slightly decreased while the no. Of unemployed ones in this segment got slightly increased.

\

In the “\textbf{More than 10 times per month}” the students did not show any change of habit, while employed and unemployed ones reduced their order frequency. It should also be noted that there has been lest no. Of participants in this segment during COVID as well as before COVID.

\end{figure}
$$\textit{Employed($63$) | Retired($1$) | Student($126$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

The bar graph in Figure \ref{G7} illustrates the vaccination status for participants with different employment condition. It has been measured in percentage.

\ 

There is $1.59\%$ employed participants who did not take any dose and a same portion with incomplete course of vaccination.  The majority of employed participants $(68.25\%)$ finished the vaccination with booster dose and $28.57\%$ without booster dose.

\

It can be observed that a very small portion of students either did not take the booster dose or  any dose. About $59.52\%$ of students got properly vaccinated and the remaining $38.10\%$ are to be vaccinated with the booster dose.

\

Among the unemployed participants only $2.50\%$ did not complete the vaccination process. While half of them got vaccinated without booster dose, $47.5\%$ completed the vaccination with booster dose.

\

It can be seen that almost all the participants are either fully vaccinated with booster dose or without booster dose.

\end{figure}
$$\textit{Employed($63$) | Retired($1$) | Student($126$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

Figure \ref{G8} shows that none of the employed candidates' medical expenses for their family members decreased by more than $10,000$ after the pandemic. Meanwhile, $0\%$ of employed candidates experienced a decrease between zero and $10,000$. About $6.35\%$ of employed candidates reported an increase of more than $10,000$ in medical expenses for their family, while $58.73\%$ reported an increase between zero and $10,000$. Additionally, $34.92\%$ of employed candidates stated that medical expenses for their family remained unchanged after the pandemic.

\

Among students, $1.59\%$ reported a decrease of more than $10,000$ in medical expenses for their family after the pandemic, while $3.97\%$ reported a decrease between zero and $10,000$. About $4.76\%$ of students experienced an increase of more than $10,000$, and $54.76\%$ reported an increase between zero and $10,000$. Furthermore, $34.92\%$ of students mentioned that medical expenses for their family remained unchanged after the pandemic.

\

For unemployed candidates, $2.50\%$ reported a decrease of more than $10,000$ in medical expenses for their family, and $2.50\%$ reported a decrease between zero and $10,000$. About $7.50\%$ of unemployed candidates experienced an increase of more than $10,000$, while $60\%$ reported an increase between zero and $10,000$. Additionally, $27.50\%$ of unemployed candidates stated that medical expenses for their family remained unchanged after the pandemic.

$$\textit{Employed($63$) | Retired($1$) | Student($126$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

Figure \ref{G9} shows that among employed candidates $61.90\%$ gained weight during the pandemic (COVID-19), $19.05\%$ lost weight, and the weight remained the same for $19.05\%$.

\ 

Among students, $65.87\%$ gained weight during the pandemic (COVID-19), $19.84\%$ lost weight, and the weight remained the same for $14.29\%$.

\ 

Among unemployed candidates, $67.50\%$ gained weight during the pandemic (COVID-19), $17.50\%$ lost weight, and the weight remained the same for $15.00\%$.

\end{figure}

Due to the impact of COVID-19, the frequency of going out has undergone a substantial change. From figure \ref{G22} we see that among the $230$ participants surveyed, $171$ individuals reported going out at most once a week during the pandemic.

\subsection{Social Interaction}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Precautions taken in four images}
    \label{all_images}
\end{figure}


\ 

The pie charts \ref{all_images} above provides an overview of the percentage distribution of the sample population across different categories related to staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately $61\%$ of individuals mostly stayed at home and remained untouched by COVID infection. Another $14\%$ of individuals contracted COVID while staying at home for unknown reason. Additionally, about $14\%$ of the population ventured out moderately during the COVID pandemic and either stayed negative or did not get tested. A small percentage $4\%$ of individuals who went out moderately got infected by the COVID virus. The percentage of people who frequently went out was small, and $4\%$ of them either stayed safe or did not get tested. Only $3\%$ of the population that went out frequently got infected with COVID.

\newpage 

Analyzing the pie chart, it becomes evident that staying at home played a crucial role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Only $18\%$ of the sample population staying at home were infected, while $82\%$ remained mostly safe. The next pie chart illustrates the infection spread due to moderate outings, showing that $23\%$ of the sample population got infected due to moderate outings during the COVID pandemic. In the last pie chart, the results of frequently staying out are shown to contribute significantly to the increase in the spread of COVID infection, rising to $44\%$. This suggests that going out frequently led to a higher risk of contamination.

\ 

The insights derived from the data are noteworthy. Staying at home emerged as a significant factor in preventing the spread of COVID and getting infected, as evidenced by the relatively low infection rate of $18\%$. However, as people went out moderately from home, the rate of infection and positive cases increased by $5\%$, indicating a relatively lower impact of moderate outings. Overall, the survey depicts that frequently staying out is a major factor contributing to the spread of COVID. Due to this factor, the infection rate rose by $26\%$ compared to staying at home.

	\includegraphics[width=0.79\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 18.png}
	\caption{Screen-time Percentage}
	\label{G18}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{G18} shows that for majority of the participants the screen time has somewhat increased during COVID 19. Before COVID-19, the majority of participants reported engaging in screen time for \textbf{1-3 hours} per day. However, with the advent of the pandemic, there has been a notable and significant increase in the number of individuals spending more than \textbf{6 hours per day} on screens. Also, the proportion of people with \textbf{less than 1 hour} of screen time per day during this period has diminished considerably. Post-COVID-19, a substantial portion of participants now falls within the range of \textbf{1-6 hours} of daily screen time.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.79\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 10.jpeg}
	\caption{Screen-time Percentage of different Employment Categories}
	\label{G10}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Figure \ref{G10} represents the screen time changes for different categories of people during COVID-19. It indicates that across all categories, screen time has somewhat increased to a large extent.

\ 

For students, employees and unemployed, the percentages are $39.68\%$, $31.75\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. Additionally, a significant percentage increase is observed for people from different categories, with percentages of $26.98\%$, $20.63\%$ and $32.5\%$ for \textit{students, employees and unemployed} respectively.

\

The data also reveals that screen time has remained the same for a substantial number of people. An interesting observation is that among those experiencing a significant increase in screen time, the proportion is highest for unemployed individuals, followed by students and employed individuals in decreasing order.

\section{Mental Health}

\subsection{Mental Health conditions}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering

	\label{G12}
\end{figure}

\

Figure \ref{G12} shows the number of responders having mental health conditions during COVID-19 pandemic. The predominant conditions reported were stress, loneliness and depression, affecting $76$, $63$ and $52$ individuals, respectively. Noteworthy outliers included cases of fatigue, tension and anxiety. It is important to highlight that a substantial proportion of participants did not experience any mental health issues during this challenging time.

\newpage

\subsection{Mental Health across different Employment categories}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}
$$\textit{Employed($63$) | Retired($1$) | Student($126$) | Unemployed($40$)}$$

\ 

Figure \ref{G11} represents the mental health status of different categories during COVID-19.

\ 

It shows that 39.5\% of students, 41.51\% of employed individuals, and 36.59\% of unemployed persons were experiencing stress. A significant number of people were also dealing with loneliness, with rates of 33.33\% for students, 35.85\% for employed individuals, and 31.71\% for the unemployed. Additionally, 27.08\% of students, 22.64\% of employed individuals, and 31.71\% of unemployed persons have faced depression.

\

The above observations depict that almost everyone in all categories has gone through a mental health crisis. A sense of uncertainty and helplessness are the main reasons behind it. Loss of families, friends, jobs, and many more have pushed us towards another significant crisis—mental health.

\end{figure}

\ 

Figure \ref{G21} provides insights into the impact of COVID-19 on the education of various age groups. 

\ 

In conclusion, the data indicate that education among children under the age of $10$ has either stayed consistent or has decreased in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. The quality of education has remained the same or has declined for children aged $10$ to $20$ and adult education has stayed stable or has deteriorated a bit.

\subsection{Association with any Institutional Activities}

Figure \ref{G24} displays the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on responder's participation in institutional activities. Before the pandemic, the frequency of engagement stood at $84$, but during the pandemic, it soared to $146$. Subsequently, post-pandemic, the frequency dropped to $98$. This dynamic pattern demonstrates a significant increase in overall responders engagement during the pandemic. On the other hand, $54$ respondents, remained uninvolved in any institutional activity for the entire period.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 28.jpeg}
	\caption{Healthy Habits}
	\label{G28}
\end{figure}

Analyzing the healthy habits taken up by the individuals reveals some interesting trends among the $230$ participants. A significant $70.43\%$ express a desire to maintain a healthy food habit, emphasizing the importance placed on nutrition in their overall well-being. Additionally, $62.17\%$ are keen on incorporating regular physical exercises into their routines, highlighting a conscious effort to stay physically active for optimal health.

\

Furthermore, the data indicates that $37.82\%$ of participants are inclined towards practicing relaxation techniques, showcasing a recognition of the importance of mental well-being. Notably, $41.30\%$ express a preference for seeking medical or psychological advice from professionals, indicating a proactive approach to managing their health through expert guidance.

\

In an intriguing dimension, $27.39\%$ of individuals express a desire to seek support from their community in building an integrated stress management society to address the challenges posed by diseases. This reflects a community-oriented mindset in combating health issues collaboratively.

\

However, $24.34\%$ of the participants seem to lack pre-planning in adopting specific healthy habits. This highlights a potential area for intervention and education to raise awareness about the benefits of proactive health measures.

\

Insights drawn from the data underscore the prominence of individuals aiming to maintain both a healthy food habit and regular physical exercises, with percentages of $70.43\%$ and $62.17\%$, respectively. This dual focus on nutrition and physical activity suggests a holistic approach to health, particularly in the context of combating severe pandemics.

\

As we navigate the challenges of the current pandemic, it becomes evident that having hygiene plans in place is a proactive measure against potential future epidemics, such as the possibility of another COVID-19-like situation within the next 20 years. The importance of developing personal and community hygiene strategies cannot be overstated, as these measures play a crucial role in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases and fostering a healthier society overall.

\section{Proclivity for Physical Exercise - Before and After COVID-19}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{IMAGES/Image 35.png}
	\caption{Physical Exercises after COVID-19}
	\label{G35}
\end{figure}

\ 

In the Bar diagram \ref{G35} illustrates findings from the aforementioned survey, showcasing the distinctions in physical exercise patterns before and after the onset of COVID-19. 

\

Based on the figure \ref{G35} depicting physical exercise frequency before and after COVID-19, it is evident that there was an increase in the frequency of physical exercise. Before COVID-19, the frequency was $79$, while after COVID-19, the frequency rose to $142$. This suggests a notable shift in exercise habits, with a higher number of individuals engaging in physical activities post-COVID-19 compared to the Pre-COVID-19 period. 

\

The increase in frequency may be attributed to various factors, such as heightened awareness of health, changes in daily routines, or a greater emphasis on physical well
being in response to the pandemic. 

\section{Evolving Impact of Widespread Sanitizer Use}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\ 

In the Bar diagram \ref{G36} represents the results of the above-mentioned survey, categorized by the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID usage of Sanitizers  

The diagram illustrates a significant change in the frequency of sanitizer usage time before and after COVID-19. Before the pandemic, the frequency of people using sanitizer was $35$, whereas after COVID-19, this frequency increased substantially to $153$. This considerable uptick in sanitizer usage suggests a heightened awareness and adherence to hygiene practices post-COVID-19. 

\

The substantial increase in frequency may be indicative of a broader societal shift towards prioritizing preventive measures for health and safety in response to the pandemic.

The Pie chart in \ref{G37} represents the distribution of Post-COVID financial coping strategies, with notable emphasis on medical insurance, varied skill acquisition, and a substantial portion undecided about future plans.

\

In summary, the analysis of post-COVID financial coping plans, as depicted in the chart, reveals a diverse landscape. Notably, $25.2\%$ of respondents prioritize their well-being with medical insurance, while $18.4\%$ consider life insurance. A proactive approach is evident, with $11.3\%$ aiming to acquire diverse skills, and $8.6\%$ exploring alternate job options. Surprisingly, only $0.3\%$ express plans for investments. Significantly, $36.2\%$ of individuals have yet to formalize specific financial strategies, underscoring the prevailing uncertainty. 

\

This numerical breakdown emphasizes the variety of approaches, highlighting the intricate and individualized nature of post-pandemic financial planning among surveyed individuals.

\ 

As we can see from Figure \ref{G38} the harsh matter of fact, it is likely for the world to face more pandemics in the near future, followed by COVID-19. However a word of hope is that we have, from our data set, the number of people likely to follow government prescribed guidelines has increased quite a bit compared to that at the time of onset of COVID-19.

\

Out of $230$ individuals, the number $114$ of people, taking up guidelines and rules at the time of the Corona Outbreak is quite less than the number $164$ of people willing to quickly follow the new guidelines if a similar history of COVID repeats itself in near future. 

\

It is conclusive that a general awareness regarding the pandemic and its control have grown among the responders.
